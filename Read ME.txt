No longer need to edit JS code.  Use case module to set/clear holidays that are derived from the JS code. 
The 3 modules, the case, set, and clear modules can be moved to parent IVRs for cases where varying 
BU’s have different holidays (i.e. integrators, etc).  Test Holiday is now fixed at 12/25/2022 so you only  
need to set the testmode to 1 to test functionality. 
 
The observed value can now be set to 3 condistions. 
0 – Only actual holidays are set 
1 – Actual and observed holidays are set (Friday prior to Saturday and Monday following Sunday). 
2 – only Monday following Sunday is set to accommodate customer that are open on Saturdays and 
	and don’t observe on Fridays.
